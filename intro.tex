\section{Introduction}

This paper describes in detail the drive beam setup and 
optimization procedures applied in CTF3.
In summary, the machine setup proceeded as follows:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Injector setup for 3 GHz beam
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item steering trough solenoids
    \item solenoids tuning
    \item pre-buncher phase and amplitude
    \item MKS03 phase tunning using segmented dump CL4
    \item tuning of girder 4 quadrupoles and compressing chicane steering 
          to deliver the beam to screen on girder CL5
    \item Optimization of MKS03 phase and compression chicane to obtain 
          the shortest bunch as observed by CL.BPR0475
    \item quad-scans at girder CL.5 and quadrupole rematch on girder 4 and 5 for good beam transport
    \item optimization of solenoids and steering through solenoids to 
          achieve smallest emttiance on girder CL5
    \item quad-scans at girder CL.5 and quadrupole rematch on girder 4 and 5 
          to get good transport and the nominal Twiss parameters for the Linac optics
  \end{enumerate}

\item Linac setup for 3 GHz beam
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item steering and klystron phase setup to deliver the beam to spectrometer CL10
    \item quad-scan at CL10 and quadrupole rematch for linac girders 6-10
    \item DFS from girder CL4 to CL10
    \item tuning of the klystron phases, including pre buncher phase and amplitude, to obtain
          minimum energy spread on CL10 segmented dump
    \item steering and klystron phase setup for girders 10-15 and CT line 
          to deliver the beam to CLS the spectrometer

    \item orbit closure
    \item DTS
    \item ring length measurement and tuning

    \item quad scan in TL2' and eventuall rematch of quads in girders 
          CC8, CC9 and CM1 to match to the TBL FODO optics

    \item quad scan in TL2' and eventuall rematch of quads in girders CC8 and CC9
    \item steering 
    \item DFS
  \end{enumerate}

\item Injector setup for 1.5~GHz beam
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Tuning phases of SHBs using the folliwng one as a BPR (maximizing loading in absence of RF).
          For the last one BPR in CL2 is used with RF of MKS02 being off.
    \item Tuning of prebuncher to get maximum CL2 BPR signal, i.e. shortest bunche
    \item Tuning of MKS03 to get shortest bunch on CL4 BPR
    \item Correcting the orbit to be on the 3GHz reference
    \item Shifting the phase of all the klystrons 5 to 15 to minimize the energy spread in CTS
    \item Verification the transport of the beam to CLEX and CR recombination.
  \end{enumerate}

\item Delay Loop 
  \begin{enumerate}
     \item The first checks done with 3~GHz beam
     \begin{enumerate}
        \item magnetic injection and steering around DL until CTS
        \item DFS
        \item quads scans in CTS and eventual optics correction in DL followed by DFS
        \item orbit closure
        \item transport of the beam to CR, verification that it combines well, transport to CLEX
        \item setup of the RF deflector: 
              every second bunch goes to DL and is delayed and recombined again
        \item closure observing the pulse shapes on all BPMs until CRM
